 Rock Paper Scissors

In this Rock, Paper, Scissors game, players select their choice between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly chooses its option. Once both choices are made, the result is determined. If the player wins, their score increases by 100 points; if they lose, the computer's score goes up by 100 points. Ties result in no change to the scores. The outcome is displayed briefly in a div with a smooth transition effect. The game continues for multiple rounds, with scores accumulating until the player decides to stop playing.
